# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#   - Looping from 1 to 19
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#   - When it reaches 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#   - That it increases by 1 each loop, and that there will
#     be an event that is triggered by its value
